# Alexandria Atwell React Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

My previous website portfolio was the beginning of a young sprout just starting to grow and expand. This time I wanted something new, I wanted to put more effort into my React Portfolio, and thus begins what I have now.

## Project Status

Completed

## Demo

## Built With

- Javascript (React)
- CSS (SCSS)
- HTML

- - Before and while starting project 3, I gained some new knowledge and some tools on a few new adventures some that I can include in my React Portfolio.

- - Significant 3rd Party tools:
  - react-particles-js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js)
    - I used this for the contact form
  - parallax.js (https://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/)
    - I used this for the moving clouds which hold my different skills
  - SVG logos (https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos)
    - I used this for many of the logos for different technologies in my skill section
  - Color Changing Background (https://codepen.io/alexzaworski/pen/mEkvAG)
    - I used this for the contact form
  - SweetAlert (https://sweetalert2.github.io/)
    - I used this for any models (this one is my favorite the alerts are very cute!!)

## Challenges

Through the development of my project I ran into a few challenges:

  -First and foremost starting up with Project 3 and also compiling my first React Portfolio.
- I used a few 3rd party libraries to implement some parts of the website
  - I first struggled on using the Particles JS (for the initial cover background) as it was my first time using it. Looking back at it, it was worth the effort.
  - I also struggled using Parallax JS (for the clouds), I still do struggle using it. Styling it was very difficult however my Tutor was an amazing and helpful guide.
- I struggle getting used to React syntax and some react in general, with practice come perfection.
  - I still juggle between using classes or functional components, I will probably choose to stick with functions in the future since functions make since. Kinda like using const instead of vars.

## What I learned

- How to use React (and 3rd party libraries) with following a tutorial
- Making use of SVGs (will definitely make more use of this for future apps)

## What's Coming Next...

-Technical Resume enable on React Portfolio
-Portfolio Picture
-Project 3 once completed
