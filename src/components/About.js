            How many folks can agree that the most satisfying part of being a Web Dev, is being able to explore your wild and creative streak? I a visionary and a want to capture all the changes  make changes to code and instantly seeing it reflected on a web page for everyone to see. I enjoy the chaotic creativity that comes with coding and the satisfaction when a code breaks, and you end up spending several hours.
            Even days, figuring what happen, and when you finally fix it, that gratifying feeling is what I want to live for! I want to build more than an app or website, I want to create the <strong>FUTURE!!</strong>
