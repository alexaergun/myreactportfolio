          <p>
          I was born in the Rocky Mountain State, of Mile High, raised in London England, with parents from Barbados; and hold triple citizenship. I was first exposed to computers as an early age from Mine Sweep to Oregon Trail.  Through playing video games only then did my love of programming only blossomed at the age of 5; I had 4 game systems Atari, Dream Cast, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis. I loved video games so much so, I knew I wanted to be a game designer.  After which I switched my passion to being a Bartender I know a huge leap away from anything computer related, I found out I don’t enjoy the aspect of drawing very much. I wanted to explore my creative side by moving my whole body. After gaining my certificate in Mixology. I went further by getting my Associates as a Pastry Chef. After which I followed up with my N.R.A Certification, as a minor hobby for myself.  So why get back into computer related subjects again? Well I’m not going lie, MONEY! I want a future, a future away from financially burden, I want to be able to travel the world with my Turkish Husband, to grow and become successful. When my husband and I have children I want the ability to take them places with no problems. When I’m not study I enjoy baking, cooking, fishing, camping, playing with my 3 cats, and making modifications to my husbands or my vehicles.

            <i>Where I'm Headed</i>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Being grateful for the vast knowledge I'm earning would be an understatement, coding is a heavy skill that I am exploring.
            However I am passionate and driven. I'm keen on gaining experience in all fields of software engineering, I've even
            grown to love <b>front end development</b>. There's something
            satisfying about being able to make changes to code and instantly
            seeing it reflected on a web page for everyone to see. I also enjoy the chaotic creativity that comes with coding.
            I want to build more than an app or website, I want to create the <b>FUTURE!!</b>
