            <em>Where I'm From</em>

          <p>
          I was born in the Rocky Mountain State, with parents from Barbados; and hold triple citizenship. I was first exposed to computers at an early age from Mine Sweep to Oregon Trail. 
          Through playing video games only then did my true love of programming only blossomed; At the age of 5 I had 4 game systems Atari, Dream Cast, Super Nintendo, and Sega Genesis. I loved video games so much so, 
          I grew up dreaming to be a game designer. After gaining my Bachelor Degree in Graphic Arts, I soon switched my passion to a Bartender. I know a huge leap away from anything computer related, the roads of exploration bekon me and I had to heed its call. 
          After gaining my certificate in Mixology. I went further by getting my Bachelor Degree as a Pastry Chef and as a minor hobby for myself I followed up with my N.R.A Certification. I had many thing I was very passionate about, still something was missing. 
          I looked back at where it all began; <strong>GAMING!!</strong> I went back into the computer world, and earned a Certificate as a Full Stack Web Devoloper. Technology is ever changing and I want to be a part of that change, I want to help influence the growth of where technology will and could be heading.

            <em>Where I'm Headed</em>
          </h3>
          <p>
            I want to be financially stable, taking time to travel the world with my amazing Husband. I want to help be a part of the new tech wave. During my free time from coding I can be baking, cooking, fishing, camping, playing with my 3 cats, 
            and making modifications to my husbands or my vehicles. I am passionate and driven. I'm keen on gaining experience in all fields of software engineering, I've even grown to love <strong>front end development</strong>. There's something
            satisfying about being able to make changes to code and instantly seeing it reflected on a web page for everyone to see. I enjoy the chaotic creativity that comes with coding and the satisfication when a code breaks, and you end up spending several hours.
            Even days, figuring what happen, and when you finally fix it, that gratifiying feeling is what I want to live for! I want to build more than an app or website, I want to create the <strong>FUTURE!!</strong>
